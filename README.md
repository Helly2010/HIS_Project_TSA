# London Energy Consumption Analysis Project

## Overview

This project investigates energy consumption patterns and their relationships with socio-demographic factors and weather indicators across European cities, particularly London, following the installation of Smart Energy Meters. The analysis spans a period of 30 months and employs exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning algorithms, and time series forecasting methods.

## Objectives

- Analyze energy consumption patterns in relation to socio-demographic and weather data.
- Evaluate the impact of Smart Energy Meter installations on energy usage.
- Develop predictive models for forecasting future energy consumption.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - Keras (for neural networks)
  - XGBoost (for gradient boosting)
  - Scikit-learn (for various machine learning algorithms)
  - Statsmodels (for statistical modeling)

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with LSTM**: For modeling sequences of energy consumption data.
